# Config and seq-file library
This folder contains sub-folders for seq-files ([seq-library](/library/seq-library)) and config files
([sim-library](/library/sim-library)) and and the corresponding python files used to create the seq-files.
Optionally, an additional library with pre-compiled and approved seq-files and config files called
[pulseq-cest-library](https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest-library) can be downloaded from GitHub.

several pre-defined and approved pre-saturation schemes
([seq-library](https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest-library/tree/master/seq-library)) as well as several pre-defined
and approved simulation settings ([sim-library](https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest-library/tree/master/sim-library)).
